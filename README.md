# 🛒 Ecommerce Microservices Architecture

This is a scalable and modular **eCommerce backend system** built using the **microservices architecture pattern**. Each service is independently developed and maintained, which helps in scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation. The services communicate via REST APIs and are orchestrated using Docker and Docker Compose.

## 📦 Microservices Overview

| Service         | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auth**        | Handles user authentication and JWT-based login/registration.  |
| **User**        | Manages user profiles and related data.                        |
| **Products**    | Manages product listing, creation, and updates.                |
| **Inventorys**  | Tracks and manages inventory stock.                            |
| **Cart**        | Handles shopping cart operations.                              |
| **Order**       | Manages order placement, status, and history.                  |
| **Email**       | Sends emails for notifications, verifications, etc.            |
| **API Gateway** | Acts as the single entry point for routing and load balancing. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js (for local service testing if needed)

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arifnextdev/ecommerce-microservice.git
   cd ecommerce-microservice
   ```

````

2. **Run using Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access Services**

   Each service will be available on its respective port (check `docker-compose.yml` for details).

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Node.js** & **Express.js**
* **Docker** & **Docker Compose**
* **REST APIs**
* **JWT Authentication**
* **Microservices Design Pattern**

---

## 📌 Features

* Independent deployable services
* Containerized architecture with Docker
* API Gateway routing
* Secure JWT authentication
* Scalable and fault-tolerant design

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can test individual services by accessing their API endpoints locally, or through Postman.

For example:

```
GET http://localhost:<auth_port>/api/auth/health
```
